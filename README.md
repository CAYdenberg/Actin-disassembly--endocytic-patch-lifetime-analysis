This code parses and analyzes intensity profiles from kymographs of endocytic patch events in yeast. It will be fully described in an upcoming paper (not yet published). Please see the paper for a full description of the experiment.

The input data are text files produced by NIS Elements (proprietary software from Nikon Instruments). These files contain columns of intensity values from a line profile along the length of a kymograph. These files are placed in the `raw` directory. They may be organized into subdirectories. The `patch_disassembly.py` script is run, which calculates corrected intensity profiles and extracts the "lifetimes" from each channel. It produces a second file containing the corrected profiles and places it in the `processed` directory. It also produces a chart of these corrected values in the `svg` directory. Finally, it writes a single line summarizing the lifetime information in the `process_patch` file. 

To summarize the lifetime information between all strains (Fig 2D and 3A in the paper), the `parse_summary_file.py` is then run, which produces the text files `actin_lifetimes.txt`, `cofilin_lifetimes.txt` and `delay_absolute.txt`. To produce the patch alignment curves (Fig 3D) the `align_at_start.py` script is run.
